WEEK 1:
What is Data Management?
1. How do we ingest the data?
Ingestion means the process of getting the data into the data system that we are building or using
- Manual input by command
- Web form or visual interface
- Automation data ingestion
2. Where and how do we store it?
- Issue of capacity (How much data to store)
- Speed of the IU operation (How fast do we need to read/write)
Storage system:
- Storage area networks (SAN)
- Network attached storage (NAS)
- Direct attached storage (DAS)
3. How can we ensure data quality?
Further the data quality management should include a well define work flow on how low quality data could be corrected to bring it back to a high level of quality.
4. What operations do we perform on the data?
- Operation on single data items that produce a sub-item
- Operation on collections of data item
5. How can these operations be efficient?
Efficiency of data operations
- Measured by time and space
- Should use paralelism
6. How do we scale up data volume, variety, velocity and access?
- Vertical scaling (Scale up): Adding more processors and RAM, buy servers
- Horizontal scaling (Scale out): Adding more, possibly less powerful machines that interconect over a network
The general trend in the big data world, however, is to target the scale out option.
7. How to keep the data secure?


WEEK 2:
What is a Data Model?
- Data Model Structure
+ Structure
+ Unstructure
- Data Model Operations
4 basic data operations 
+ Selection
+ Projection
+ Union
+ Join
- Data Model Constraints
Type of constraint
+ Value constraint
+ Uniqueness constraint
+ Cardinality constraint
+ Type constraint
+ Domain constraint
Structure of constraint
+ Put restriction on the structure of the data rather than the data values themselves

Some different data models:
- Relation Data Model
- Semistructure Data Model
- Array Data Model
